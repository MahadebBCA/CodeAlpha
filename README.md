# CodeAlpha Internship

I have started my first internship at **CodeAlpha** in the **Web Development** domain.  
This is a **remote internship**, and Iâ€™m excited to learn various technologies and build my skills.

This **Age Calculator** is my first task on the first day of my internship.  
I really enjoyed writing this project because it helped me understand:
- How to work with **JavaScript Date objects**
- How to handle **DOM manipulation**
- How to manage **various JavaScript events**

In this repository, I have explained my code clearly.  
This shows what I have learned while completing this task at CodeAlpha.

I am looking forward to learning more and building more projects during this internship!
